# A good faith vulnerability researcher is someone who:

1. Examines application and system vulnerabilities, conducts research on emerging threats and vulnerabilities, provides mitigation recommendations, and reports their findings to a vulnerability owner or to the public
    
1. Does not intentionally damage property in the pursuit of vulnerabilities (viewing, copying, or disseminating data is not damage)
    
1. Designs and carries out their pursuit of vulnerabilities in such a manner as to avoid, as best as possible, any intentional harm to individuals or the public
   
1. Follows local laws to the best of their ability and knowledge, including reporting and paying taxes on their income to any relevant taxation agencies
    
1. If a vulnerability owner has been nonresponsive, uses the common best practice of waiting at least:
   
   a. 30 days to publicly disclose a vulnerability that could harm human health or life in critical infrastructure

   b. 60 days to publicly disclose a software or firmware vulnerability

   c. 180 days to publicly disclose a physical vulnerability (e.g. one found in a physical lock or the          firmware/hardware of an electronic access control system)

1. In the event of no response from a vulnerability owner during the waiting period, the good faith vulnerability researcher:

    a. should disclose immediately to an escrow partner if it is a critical infrastructure vulnerability, and disclosure should be as close in time as possible of notification to the vulnerability owner

     b. may disclose an IT/OT or physcial vulnerability to government before public disclosure, as part         of good faith security research practice
   
1. In the event of a response that establishes a line of communications from a vulnerability, the good faith vulnerability researcher:

     a. Does not disclose a reported vulnerability before the agreed-upon deadline established in         prior communications with the vulnerability owner
   
1. (When the situation arises) Prioritizes the safety and health of others over financial gain and immediately reports to a relevant government agency, if an ICS/SCADA vulnerability found that is or could be actively harming people physically.
    
1. Does not withhold the details of a vulnerability in demand for payment from a vulnerability owner.  If a vulnerability owner refuses to pay or does not wish disclosure to them, makes one of three choices:
    
    a. publicly disclosing the vulnerability without intention of profit
    
    b. or disclosing to a relevant escrow partner for assistance in disclosure without intention of profit

    c. or publicly disclosing the vulnerability without intention of profit, and is publicly or privately acknowledged by the escrow partner
   
### Instances where good faith vulnerability research disclosures have advanced public safety and security:

    a. "Will Your Airliner Get Hacked? Meet the people who are making sure it won’t." Source:                    https://www.smithsonianmag.com/air-space-magazine/will-your-airliner-get-hacked-180976752/

    b. (add a few more)

* The purpose of this document is: How does a policymaker recognize a researcher as opposed to a criminal? It’s someone who abides by the international code of conduct. It must work at an international level.


* We define "good faith" as "having honest or sincere intentions" to abide by the communications they have established with vulnerability owners and who understand the impact of their actions on the public while trying to not harm people.
* Critical infrastructure definition:
"System and assets, whether physical or virtual, so vital to the U.S. that the incapacity or destruction of such systems and assets would have a debilitating impact on security, national economic security, national public health or safety, or any combination of those matters." Source: https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/critical_infrastructure#:~:text=Definitions%3A,any%20combination%20of%20those%20matters

* Escrow partner: a government or private organization that can mediate between a researcher and a vulnerability owner, and has the ability to shield the researcher's identity as well as balance the need for a public response to critical infrastructure vulnerabiities and other vulnerabilities.

* Vulnerability owner: whoever owns the system in which the vulnerability has been found. May be a government entity, a private company, or other organization or person.

- impacts to physical and digital infrastructures that society relies on; e.g. water and wastewater / electric / oil and gas / telecommunications / finance / health / government, sectors that rely on Industrial Control Systems (ICS) and SCADA systems, common third party / supply chain software and applications


- Case studies: 
  
* The number of days to wait before disclosure is based on two things; an average of the lengths of time published by organizations such as Google’s Project Zero, US CISA, and vulnerability reporting mechanisms for such companies as Splunk, Symantec, Master Lock, and more - and second, what would be commonly seen as a reasonable waiting time amongst cybersecurity researchers and vulnerability owners (at least according to their documentation).

* For lines 11/12, switch. Depending on severity, should release to relevant government agency first before public
* Concerned about Line 10 overall. There should be a push for vendors to compensate good faith researchers regardless of outcome.
