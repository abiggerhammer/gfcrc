# A good faith vulnerability researcher is someone who:

1. Uses the common best practice of waiting at least 60 days to disclose a vulnerability publicly if a company has been non responsive 
2. Uses the common best practice of waiting at least 30 days to publicly disclose a vulnerability that is found in critical infrastructure
3. Uses the common best practice of waiting at least 180 days to publicly disclose a physical vulnerability (e.g. one found in a physical lock or the firmware/hardware of an electronic access control system)
4. Prioritizes the safety and health of others over financial gain (if an ICS/SCADA vulnerability found that is actively harming people physically, report to a relevant govt agency ASAP)
5. Does not disclose a company-reported vulnerability before the agreed-upon deadline established in prior communications
6. Does not withhold the details of a vulnerability in demand for payment from a company, and if a company refuses to pay or does not wish disclosure to them, makes one of two choices:
a. publicly disclosing the vulnerability without profit
b. or disclosing to a relevant government agency without profit
7. Follows local laws to the best of their ability
8. Does not intentionally damage property in the pursuit of vulnerabilities (viewing, copying, or disseminating data is not damage)

* The number of days to wait before disclosure is based on two things; an average of the lengths of time published by organizations such as Googleâ€™s Project Zero, US CISA, and vulnerability reporting mechanisms for such companies as Splunk, Symantec, Master Lock, and more - and second, what would be commonly seen as a reasonable waiting time amongst cybersecurity researchers and vulnerability owners (at least according to their documentation).

TODO: fixes on max length, cadence, options for responsive/nonresponsive - demands def of company not acting in good faith as well which is already in doc
